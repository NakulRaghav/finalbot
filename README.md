The AzureBot is a sample that showcases how the Microsoft Bot Framework and Cognitive services can be used to create intelligent bots. The sample was created to show how a bot can be used to improve the productivity of any developer, admin, or team working with Azure. If you would like to set it up yourself and contribute, follow our Developer Set Up.

As of January 29, 2018 we no longer maintain or host this Bot.

The current implementation focuses on authenticating to the user's Azure subscription, selecting and switching subscriptions, starting and stopping RM-based virtual machines, and listing and starting Azure Automation runbooks.
